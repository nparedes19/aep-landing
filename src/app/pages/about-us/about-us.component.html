                <p class="textInfoGeneral">AEP Architecture was founded in 2020 by Alcibiades Estupiñán, a Colombian architect and graduate of Universidad San Buenaventura in Cali, Colombia.
                    What began as a personal vision has grown into a collaborative design studio dedicated to creating thoughtful, sustainable spaces for everyday life.
                    The studio is built on a simple belief: that intentional design has the power to improve lives, shape meaningful experiences, and deepen our connection to the spaces we inhabit.
                    Our process is rooted in curiosity, discovery, and collaboration. We guide each client through a thoughtful design journey that uncovers the unique identity of every project, its goals, context, and connection to the surrounding landscape.
                    The result is spaces that reflect the people who inhabit them and respond gracefully to their environment.</p>

                Sustainability is at the core of our work. We integrate native plants, timeless materials, and site-specific strategies to design spaces that respect the natural and cultural character of each location. From intimate residential renovations to large-scale commercial developments, our approach is always guided by clarity, empathy, and design excellence.
            </p>
            <p class="textInfoGeneral">Our multidisciplinary team of architects, designers, and landscape specialists embraces each challenge with an open mind and creative problem-solving. We believe that successful built environments emerge from thoughtful, integrated solutions that honor vision, function, context, and budget.</p>
